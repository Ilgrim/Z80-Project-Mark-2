\noindent
\textbf{32 bit arithmetic shift right}

\subsubsection{Description:}
 The contents of maths\_op\_a are shifted one bit to the right.  The most  significant bit is left unaltered (so the sign of the number is not changed).  [31] -\textgreater  [31 -\textgreater  0] -\textgreater  [C] Flags:  maths\_flags[Z] is set if the result is zero, reset otherwise  maths\_flags[C] is set if the lsb was 1 before the operation, reset otherwise The contents of the accumulator are not preserved by this operation, other registers are unaffected.

\subsection{maths\_asrn32}
\textit{maths.z8a:147 - \$0439}

\noindent
\textbf{32 bit arithmetic shift right by n bits}

\subsubsection{Description:}
 The contents of maths\_op\_a are shifted a number of bits to the right.  The number of bits to shift is specified by the contents of \textbf{A} (the value is masked to 5 bits to provide a maximum of 31 bit shift).  The most significant bit is propagated down each shift (so the sign of the number is not changed).  [31] -n\textgreater  [31 -\textgreater  0] -n\textgreater  [C] Flags:  maths\_flags[Z] is set if the result is zero, reset otherwise  maths\_flags[C] is set if the last bit shifted out of bit 0 was 1, reset  otherwise The contents of the accumulator are not preserved by this operation, other registers are unaffected.

\subsection{ram\_top}
\textit{statics.z8a:116 - \$1000}

\noindent
\textbf{A pointer to the last byte in RAM}

\subsubsection{Description:}
 On boot the system runs a check through all memory addresses until it finds a location where RAM is present.  This allows the system to be used with a less than full memory address space. Access: Read-only

\subsection{stack}
\textit{statics.z8a:140 - \$1fff}

\noindent
\textbf{The bottom of (highest address used by) the stack}

\subsubsection{Description:}
 The stack pointer is set to this location at boot and it grows downwards.  At boot the bootup routines are stored between \$1000 and \$17FF, so the stack is limited to the 2K region above this.  Once the bootloader has loaded an operating system, execution moves above the stack and it can extend down to the top of the variables area at \$1000 (now giving it a full 4K of room).

\subsection{system\_clock}
\textit{statics.z8a:128 - \$1004}

\noindent
\textbf{The speed of the Z80 clock in Hz}

\subsubsection{Description:}
 On boot the clock speed is selected by a BIOS parameter held in the supervisor PIC's EEPROM memory.  During the boot process this setting is  queried and saved to memory.  This can be used in timing critical applications, or to compensate for various clock speeds. Access: Read-only
