\chapter{PIC BIOS Commands}
After boot, the PIC becomes a slave device on the Z80 I/O bus.  It can then be
interrupted by either a serial command on the debug port from a host PC (see
Chapter \ref{chap:debug}) or by a command from the Z80.

\section{Protocol}
The PIC uses a similar protocol to the Vinculum USB host to throttle access,
there are two flags in the Z80's STATUS register; SD\_TXE and SD\_RXF.  These
two flags permit reading (SD\_RXF) when low and writing (SD\_TXE) when low.  The
PIC will never talk without first being requested for data so SD\_RXF will only
go low when a request has been completed and resulted in some data.  There is a
third bit in the STATUS register called SD\_RDY, this is asserted (low) by the
PIC when an SD card is attached and has been successfully initialised.  Failure
to check the state of this pin before requesting data from the SD card will
almost certainly result in a timeout and garbage data.

\section{Commands}
Commands take the form of single byte values.  There are only 64 commands higher
values are masked so will execute whatever command is specified by the lower six
bits.  If the value is not mentioned below, that command is not used and will
perform no operation.

Commands should be written command and then all bytes of argument in sequence.
No acknowledgement is provded after individual bytes.  If the bytes cause any
processing time to be required the SD\_TXE flag will be set high to prevent
further writes until the PIC is ready for the next byte.  Responses are made as
quickly as possible and are signified by a lowering of SD\_RXF (also SD\_INT).

\subsection{BIOS\_RESET\_CMD \$3F}
This command takes no arguments and returns no data.  On reception of this
command the PIC will immediately do a full system reset (as if the front panel
reset button had been pressed).

\subsection{BIOS\_READ\_VAR\_CMD \$0A}
Takes one byte argument; the address to be read, returns one byte of data; the
contents of requested address in the PIC's internal EEPROM memory.  This is used
to fetch BIOS parameters such as the boot order and system clock speed.

Defined registers:\\
\noindent BIOS_BOOT_ADDRESS, Address \$00, contains the BIOS boot order.
\noindent BIOS_CLOCK_ADDRESS, Ad

\subsection{BIOS\_WRITE\_VAR\_CMD \$0B}
Takes two byte arguments; the address followed by the data.  Works in the same
way as BIOS\_READ\_VAR\_CMD to write to the PIC's internal EEPROM memory.  No
response is made on the completion of this command.
