This is a homebrew Z80 project aiming to build a disk based Z80 computer and
some software, from scratch.  This is my second attempt hence the mark 2 name.

The source in the repository is split mainly by the host processor it runs on.
Z80 is the bootloader ROM for the Z80 chip, the pic directory contains the code
for the supervisor PIC that loads the ROM image into system RAM, and hosts the
SD card and debugger.  The kb_pic is the PS/2 keyboard driver and ASCII
convertor.  The prop folder contains all the source for the Parallax Propeller
based GPU. The os folder has the beginings of the OS code which is loaded from
disk by the bootloader.  The doc folder has all the documentation for the
project.

Hope this is of some interest to someone, a large part of the motivation for
documenting all this is so I don't forget what I'm doing.  This has already
taken over 6 months to get this far so it's easy to forget what I was doing on
stuff at the start.
